# friendlyVO
A mechanism for making your images available in the Virtual Observatory. At the moment, it can only take as input links to images hosted elsewhere, but in future we'd like to add the capability to upload images directly to Zenodo (http://zenodo.org/) to remove even that extra step of sharing your data.
